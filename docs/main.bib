	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {Online voting is a trend that is gaining momentum in modern society. It has great potential to decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations—voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection. Despite these beneﬁts, online voting solutions are viewed with a great deal of caution because they introduce new threats. A single vulnerability can lead to large-scale manipulations of votes. Electronic voting systems must be legitimate, accurate, safe, and convenient when used for elections. Nonetheless, adoption may be limited by potential problems associated with electronic voting systems. Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues and offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and is used to produce electronic voting systems mainly because of their end-to-end veriﬁcation advantages. This technology is a beautiful replacement for traditional electronic voting solutions with distributed, non-repudiation, and security protection characteristics. The following article gives an overview of electronic voting systems based on blockchain technology. The main goal of this analysis was to examine the current status of blockchain-based voting research and online voting systems and any related difﬁculties to predict future developments. This study provides a conceptual description of the intended blockchain-based electronic voting application and an introduction to the fundamental structure and characteristics of the blockchain in connection to electronic voting. As a consequence of this study, it was discovered that blockchain systems may help solve some of the issues that now plague election systems. On the other hand, the most often mentioned issues in blockchain applications are privacy protection and transaction speed. For a sustainable blockchain-based electronic voting system, the security of remote participation must be viable, and for scalability, transaction speed must be addressed. Due to these concerns, it was determined that the existing frameworks need to be improved to be utilized in voting systems.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is among the most promising new technologies due to its unique features, encompassing security, privacy, data integrity, and immutability. Blockchain applications include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Recently, many other applications have begun to deploy blockchain in their systems. These applications include internet of things ({IoT}) environments. Although deploying blockchain in {IoT} architecture has yielded numerous advantages, issues and challenges have arisen that require further research. Most {IoT} devices and platforms have limited storage capacity, low battery power, and limited hardware resources for computation and network communication. Thus, energy efficiency is a critical factor in these devices. On the other hand, blockchain requires extensive resources and high computational capabilities for mining and communication processes. Balancing computation complexity and {IoT} resources is a fundamental design challenge in implementing blockchain functions, including the hash function, which is crucial to blockchain design for the mining process. In this study, we present a literature review on the common hash functions used in blockchain-based applications, in addition to the lightweight hash functions available in literature. We evaluate and test the common lightweight hash functions ({SPONGENT}, {PHOTON}, and {QUARK}) on {FPGA} platforms to determine which is most suitable for blockchain-{IoT} devices. Moreover, we assess lightweight hash functions in terms of area, power, energy, security, and throughput. The results show tradeoffs between these hash functions. {SPONGENT} performs best on security and throughput. {QUARK} consumes the least power and energy but has the lowest security parameters. {PHOTON} utilizes less area and offers a balance between multiple performance metrics (area, energy, and security), rendering it the most suitable lightweight hash function.},

@online{national_democratic_institute_transparency_2013,
	title = {Transparency},
	url = {https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/transparency},
	abstract = {Transparency is a key principle for credible elections. A transparent election process is one in which each step is open to scrutiny by stakeholders (political parties, election observers and voters alike), who are able to independently verify the process is conducted according to procedures and no irregularities have occurred.7 Providing transparency in an election helps establish trust and public confidence in the process, as voters have a means to verify the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people. Electronic voting and counting technologies pose a challenge to ensuring transparency, since many visually-verifiable steps in a traditional election (such as how ballots were marked) are automated inside a machine and, therefore, cannot be seen by the voter and others. In such circumstances, particular efforts must be made to provide transparency in each step of the process. A degree of transparency can be afforded through the design of the voting and counting technology. For instance, a {VVPAT} produces a paper record that can be checked by the voter to make sure the vote is accurately recorded. A paper record also provides the possibility of an auditable process. End-to-end verification systems allow a check to be conducted that all votes have been accurately recorded and tabulated. Equally important to the transparency of Election Day is the transparency of the development of the technology itself. The procurement, development, testing and certification of voting and counting equipment should be carried out transparently, so stakeholders are confident the machines meet relevant requirements, function properly and have the necessary security features in place. Stakeholders may have limited capacity to make use of these transparency mechanisms and may have to adapt their expertise to fully use them. The {EMB} can help observers in this regard by educating them on the electronic voting or counting system being used and how they can effectively observe it. Certain mechanisms for providing transparency, such as the use of open source code, may be controversial, as vendors may be reluctant to disclose source code citing protection of intellectual property and the security of technologies. Irrespective of these interests, however, all software and hardware should be made available for independent review. Electoral contestants and election observers have a critical role to play in ensuring the transparency of an election process. It is not possible for everyone to understand e-voting and counting systems. Thus, voters rely on others who have the capacity to understand these processes. It is therefore essential that stakeholders, including election observers and party/candidate agents, have access to the process. To carry out their role effectively, such monitors must be given sufficient access both in law and practice to make an informed assessment. This may require that additional points of observation be created in the electoral process. With traditional paper-based voting and manual counting, observers focus on the voting and counting process itself. Electronic voting and counting technologies entail a number of other activities, some critical to the integrity of the process, that can be observed, but which take place well in advance of Election Day. Such activities include the testing and certification of the systems and the installation of software on voting or counting machines. Those observing elections need to make additional efforts to monitor these processes, which take place outside of the normal window of election observation. Observers and party/candidate agents must also have access to relevant documentation about the procurement, development, testing and certification of equipment. It is critical they are able to observe during each stage of the process, from the initial decision making about whether to use electronic voting, to the final announcement of results. The transparency of various stages of the process should be a key consideration in the observers’ overall assessment of the election. The ability of observers and party/candidate agents to fulfill their roles is more challenging in an election that uses electronic voting and counting technologies. Observers must be properly trained to understand and report on the processes they observe. Watching voters use an electronic voting machine is unlikely to provide the information necessary to effectively assess the voting process. They should, therefore, become knowledgeable about the specific technologies that have been adopted and should be prepared to evaluate the testing and auditing of the voting and counting equipment, as well as the documentation of the process.8 Since election observers and party/candidate agents may not have the expertise needed to understand certain aspects of electronic voting and counting technologies, organizations and parties may need to hire personnel specifically with an information and communications technology ({ICT}) background. They may also decide they are unable to assess certain aspects of the process and, if so, should disclose in their reporting which parts of the process they have and have not been able to observe effectively and take this into account in their overall assessment of electoral integrity. The complex nature of electronic voting and counting technologies may also require {ICT} experts to provide independent oversight of such technologies, especially regarding the review of software and hardware. Professional {ICT} groups and academic communities can play a useful role in assessing electronic voting, either in partnership with election observer groups or independently. While the {EMB} should not exclude organizations that are skeptical about the benefits of electronic voting or counting technologies, they should be aware of any such organizational agendas. 7 For more detailed information on this topic, please refer to the following subsections in Part 2: Pilot Project; Legal and Procedural Framework; Procurement, Production, and Delivery; Security Mechanisms; Voter Education; and Testing, Source Code Review and Certification. 8 For more detail on this point see Council of Europe (2011) Guidelines on transparency of e-enabled elections, available at www.coe.int.  {EXAMPLE}: Verifiability {NEXT}: Integrity  Back Home Next},

	abstract = {This research sets out to analyze the message promoted by start-up enterprises that apply blockchain technologies for the purpose of e-voting [blockchain-powered e-voting ({BPE})], and their perceived effects of this technological solution on democratic outcomes. Employing Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis ({CDA}), I examined the written output of seven {BPE} start-ups (Agora, {DemocracyEarth}, Follow My Vote, Polys, Voatz, Votem, and {VoteWatcher}), as displayed in their websites. The close attention of {CDA} to power relations brought out relevant topics of discussion for analysis. Notably, these included: voting as an expression of democracy; technological determinism; individual versus communitarian understandings of democracy; the prominence of neoliberalism and the economic sphere; and technological literacy. Findings from the literature suggest that the assumptions of {BPE} start-ups about a blockchain-powered democracy diverge from widely accepted understandings of democracy. {BPE} start-ups envision a democracy determined by positions and institutions of power, by the technologically able, and by economic interests. This research argues that this conception of democracy disempowers voters from any form of decision-making regarding how democracy is run beyond their expression in the form of a vote decided by these established powers. The widespread addresses to existing elites to enable {BPE}, as well as what is left unsaid about community, collective rights and the not so technologically literate population, imply that {BPE} developers display concern for one particular expression among the many diverse and heterogeneous understandings of democracy, while disregarding outstanding privacy, security and accountability concerns associated to implementations of the technology for {BPE}. This work is a contribution to much needed research on technology and democracy’s deepening intersections, at a time of rapid technological innovation and turbulent democratic scepticism.},

The primary purpose of this review is to study the up-to-date state of blockchain-based voting research along with associated possible challenges while aiming to forecast future directions. The methodology applied in the review is a systematic review approach. Following an introduction to the basic structure and features of the blockchain in relation to e-voting, we provide a conceptual description of the desired blockchain-based e-voting application. Symmetrical and asymmetrical cryptography improvements play a key role in developing blockchain systems. We have extracted and reviewed 63 research papers from scientiﬁc databases that have advised the adoption of the blockchain framework to voting systems. These articles indicate that blockchain-supported voting systems may provide diﬀerent solutions than traditional e-voting. We classiﬁed the main prevailing issues into the ﬁve following categories: general, integrity, coin-based, privacy and consensus. As a result of this research, it was determined that blockchain systems can provide solutions to certain problems that prevail in current election systems. On the other hand, privacy protection and transaction speed are most frequently emphasized problems in blockchain applications. Security of remote participation and scalability should be improved for sustainable blockchain based e-voting. It was concluded that frameworks needed enhancements in order to be used in voting systems due to these reservations.},

Speciﬁcally, in the electoral processes, where the difﬁculty of fulﬁlling the social distance and the mobility restrictions reopen the debate on the implementation of other more advanced and modern alternatives, such as electronic voting (e-voting). This article presents the design and implementation of a decentralized e-voting system that has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, and cost-efﬁciency. Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and smart contracts are used to cast votes, which are then recorded in an immutable way, giving voters anonymity and trust in the fairness of the election process. In addition, promising results of the performance of the e-voting system in terms of latency and transaction load are presented.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin has emerged as the leading cryptographic currency since its inception in 2009 and at
the time of writing holds a market capitalization of \$28.4 billion. This ever-increasing figure
has attracted adopters seeking to advance their investments, often leaving purely technical
aspects on the sidelines. As is the case with any innovative technology, misconceptions are
plentiful and information is not always conclusive. The research effort presented in this paper
consists of a quantitative study seeking to address the subject of user anonymity in the
Bitcoin network by employing an online survey on one of the most prominent Bitcoin forums.
This includes 50 eligible participants, whose motivation is derived through the application of
temporal motivation theory. The survey seeks to form an understanding of user attitudes
towards the aspect of anonymity by following a methodological approach for exploring
common tendencies among the representatives and will serve as the underlying data set from
which conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, this paper will present a literary study of the
actual state of anonymity in this peer-to-peer technology by reviewing current findings
highlighted in the area, thus presenting a comprehensive view of anonymity in the Bitcoin
network, which will contrast the user study.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or
digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in
the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. And, once
entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of
every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer­to­peer digital currency, is the
most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly
controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of
applications in both financial and non­financial world.
The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed
consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a
digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for
developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are
tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology and revolution in this space has just begun.
This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both
financial and non­financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities
in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.},

The aim of doing so is to identify current research topics and open challenges for future studies in smart contract research. We extract 24 papers from different scientific databases. The results show that about two thirds of the papers focus on identifying and tackling smart contract issues. Four key issues are identified, namely, codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. The rest of the papers focuses on smart contract applications or other smart contract related topics. Research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies are provided.},

The goal of this workshop is to provide a multidisciplinary forum to address questions such as: How to model the interactions between people, data, and digital tools that create new spaces and forms of civic action in the digital era? How to analyse emerging properties and types of knowledge in these contexts? How to design socio-technical systems that effectively leverage data and knowledge for deliberation (or other types of participation) and collective decision making? Can we design the meta-rules of the emergent ecosystems?
The Workshop brings together participants from universities and research centers in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Brazil, Israel, {UK}, and the {USA}. The workshop received 10 submissions, covering a number of different areas in {AI} (e.g. multi-agent systems and machine learning), economics, political sciences, and law. All submitted versions were reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. These proceedings finally include nine of these papers and an invited keynote speech by Patrick Keyzer.
We sincerely thank the Program Committee members for reviewing all submitted papers and providing feedback to improve their revised versions. We are also grateful to the {IJCAI} 2017 chairs (Program Chair Carles Sierra, Workshops Chair Daniele Magazzeni and Local Arrangements co-Chair Andy Song) for their support in preparing this workshop. Last but not least, we would like to thank the participants who submitted their papers and afterwards produced the revised versions that are now composing these proceedings.},

	abstract = {The 2016 presidential election provided a unique opportunity to revisit two competing hypotheses for how voters establish their perceptions of electoral integrity. First, mass public opinion is believed to derive from elite messages. In the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump maintained that the election system was “rigged,” while election administration experts and officials received considerable media coverage in their efforts to counter Trump’s claims. Second, literature on voter confidence has established a “winner effect”—voters who cast ballots for winners are more likely than voters on the losing side to believe their vote was counted correctly. Thus, voters were exposed to two theoretically opposite effects. In this paper, we find that the “winner” effect mitigates the effects from strong pre-election cues from elites. We also show the effect of pre-election attention to the rigging issue, find a symmetry of the election outcome effect for winners and losers, and reconsider our explanations of the winner effect. Finally, we go beyond the existing studies of the winner effect to consider the kind of citizens who are most susceptible to that effect.},

With decentralization, efficiency comes to require something more: the truthful revelation of preferences. Schemes that elicit honest preferences are derived here.

This study provides a systematic review of previous studies comprising of frameworks, methods, working prototypes and simulations that demonstrate the application of smart contracts in organizations. Understanding the current state and usage of smart-contract technology in an organization is a focal point of this paper. Much progress occurs in developing technologies that support smart contracts, while little understanding exists pertaining to their usage in organizations. In this study, we identify properties of smart-contract applications in different domains of modern organizations. We further analyze and categorize challenges and problems mitigating the adoption of smart-contract applications.},

	title = {Evaluation of Approaches for Designing and Developing Decentralized Applications},
	abstract = {Blockchain as a novel technology has shown the capacity to transform multiple sectors. Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizations functions to blockchain-based systems. Blockchain technology is still mitigated by issues such as transaction cost scalability, usability, security flaws, etc. Identifying existing software modelling approaches that address the limitations of blockchain systems is difficult. Traditional system design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on the blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software development techniques used in designing decentralized applications ({DApp}). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing blockchain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for {DApp} designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose a new model-driven framework for designing blockchain applications.},

	title = {Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups},
	abstract = {A number of organizations who do not trust one another can build and maintain a highly-secured computer system that they can all trust (if they can agree on a workable design). A variety of examples from both the public and private sector illustrate the need for these systems. Cryptographic techniques make such systems practical, by allowing stored and communicated data to be protected while only a small mechanism, called a vault, need be physically secured. Once a vault has been inspected and sealed, any attempt to open it will cause it to destroy its own information content, rendering the attack useless. A decision by a group of trustees can allow such a vault-or even a physically destroyed vault -to be re-established safely. Networks of vaults can allow reliable operation even in the face of communication channel and vault failures. Networks also have several security advantages over single vault systems: (1) information that is no longer needed can be permanently destroyed, (2) comprehensive records of security relevant actions by the trustees can be maintained, and (3) abuse of the trustees' power requires advance notice. Algorithms which implement such a network are presented in a specially adapted formal specification language; examples of the algorithms' use are given; analysis of communication, memory and time requirements are presented; and security and reliability properties are proved. Each of some mutually suspicious groups can supply part of a vault, in such a way that each group need only trust its part in order to be able to trust the entire vault. Another approach to construction is based on public selection of a system's component parts at random from a large store of equivalent parts. The practicality and ramifications of the ideas presented are also considered.},

For this, many technological implementations and security policies have been developed. The amount of data, transferred, is not a factor. The basic factor is, how much security, the channel provides while transmitting data. Cryptography is one such technique, which allows secure data transmission without losing its confidentiality and integrity. Based on the key distribution, cryptography is further classified into two major types-Symmetric Key Cryptography and Asymmetric Key Cryptography. In this paper, we have surveyed the traditional algorithms, along with the proposed algorithms based on their pros and cons, related to Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Cryptography. We have also compared the importance of both these cryptographic techniques. The proposed algorithms proved to be highly efficient in their respective grounds but there are certain areas that remained open, related to these algorithms, and have not yet been thoroughly discussed. This paper also presents an appropriate future scope related to these open fields.},

Conventional voting suffers many issues, such as cost of time and efforts needed for tallying and counting results, cost in papers ,arrangements and all that it takes for a voting process to be achieved. Many countries such as Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Namibia, the Netherlands ,Norway, Peru, Switzerland, the {UK}, Venezuela and the Philippines considered online e-voting systems, but the traditional e-voting systems suffer a lack of trust, it is not known if a vote is counted correctly, tampered or not. The voter has no guarantee that his/her vote is considered as they voted in elections, it's a lack of transparency. A solution is e-voting systems based on blockchain (sometimes referred as Distributed Ledger Technology ({DLT})) has now turned to be promising for what properties it offer, such as, privacy, security, transparency, accuracy, decentralization in which no central control exist, and most of all, creates an immutable system, where citizens are allowed to vote from their location by using digital devices (smart phones, computers, electronic voting machines). Also, due to the {COVID}-19 pandemic, many technology applications are heading towards systems with all these properties, at the same time, maintaining social distancing. This review introduced many different ideas for implementing e-voting systems based on Blockchain and how the users (voters and candidates) interact with the system showing the voting process from the first step of registration to authentication till showing the final results. At the end of this review we will illustrate a table that contain all mechanisms used in the papers involved that covers the most important requirements needed for every e-voting system based on blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology ({DLT}).},
