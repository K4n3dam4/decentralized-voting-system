	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {Online voting is a trend that is gaining momentum in modern society. It has great potential to decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations—voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection. Despite these beneﬁts, online voting solutions are viewed with a great deal of caution because they introduce new threats. A single vulnerability can lead to large-scale manipulations of votes. Electronic voting systems must be legitimate, accurate, safe, and convenient when used for elections. Nonetheless, adoption may be limited by potential problems associated with electronic voting systems. Blockchain technology came into the ground to overcome these issues and offers decentralized nodes for electronic voting and is used to produce electronic voting systems mainly because of their end-to-end veriﬁcation advantages. This technology is a beautiful replacement for traditional electronic voting solutions with distributed, non-repudiation, and security protection characteristics. The following article gives an overview of electronic voting systems based on blockchain technology. The main goal of this analysis was to examine the current status of blockchain-based voting research and online voting systems and any related difﬁculties to predict future developments. This study provides a conceptual description of the intended blockchain-based electronic voting application and an introduction to the fundamental structure and characteristics of the blockchain in connection to electronic voting. As a consequence of this study, it was discovered that blockchain systems may help solve some of the issues that now plague election systems. On the other hand, the most often mentioned issues in blockchain applications are privacy protection and transaction speed. For a sustainable blockchain-based electronic voting system, the security of remote participation must be viable, and for scalability, transaction speed must be addressed. Due to these concerns, it was determined that the existing frameworks need to be improved to be utilized in voting systems.},

	abstract = {This research sets out to analyze the message promoted by start-up enterprises that apply blockchain technologies for the purpose of e-voting [blockchain-powered e-voting ({BPE})], and their perceived effects of this technological solution on democratic outcomes. Employing Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis ({CDA}), I examined the written output of seven {BPE} start-ups (Agora, {DemocracyEarth}, Follow My Vote, Polys, Voatz, Votem, and {VoteWatcher}), as displayed in their websites. The close attention of {CDA} to power relations brought out relevant topics of discussion for analysis. Notably, these included: voting as an expression of democracy; technological determinism; individual versus communitarian understandings of democracy; the prominence of neoliberalism and the economic sphere; and technological literacy. Findings from the literature suggest that the assumptions of {BPE} start-ups about a blockchain-powered democracy diverge from widely accepted understandings of democracy. {BPE} start-ups envision a democracy determined by positions and institutions of power, by the technologically able, and by economic interests. This research argues that this conception of democracy disempowers voters from any form of decision-making regarding how democracy is run beyond their expression in the form of a vote decided by these established powers. The widespread addresses to existing elites to enable {BPE}, as well as what is left unsaid about community, collective rights and the not so technologically literate population, imply that {BPE} developers display concern for one particular expression among the many diverse and heterogeneous understandings of democracy, while disregarding outstanding privacy, security and accountability concerns associated to implementations of the technology for {BPE}. This work is a contribution to much needed research on technology and democracy’s deepening intersections, at a time of rapid technological innovation and turbulent democratic scepticism.},

@online{national_democratic_institute_transparency_2013,
	title = {Transparency},
	url = {https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/transparency},
	abstract = {Transparency is a key principle for credible elections. A transparent election process is one in which each step is open to scrutiny by stakeholders (political parties, election observers and voters alike), who are able to independently verify the process is conducted according to procedures and no irregularities have occurred.7 Providing transparency in an election helps establish trust and public confidence in the process, as voters have a means to verify the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people. Electronic voting and counting technologies pose a challenge to ensuring transparency, since many visually-verifiable steps in a traditional election (such as how ballots were marked) are automated inside a machine and, therefore, cannot be seen by the voter and others. In such circumstances, particular efforts must be made to provide transparency in each step of the process. A degree of transparency can be afforded through the design of the voting and counting technology. For instance, a {VVPAT} produces a paper record that can be checked by the voter to make sure the vote is accurately recorded. A paper record also provides the possibility of an auditable process. End-to-end verification systems allow a check to be conducted that all votes have been accurately recorded and tabulated. Equally important to the transparency of Election Day is the transparency of the development of the technology itself. The procurement, development, testing and certification of voting and counting equipment should be carried out transparently, so stakeholders are confident the machines meet relevant requirements, function properly and have the necessary security features in place. Stakeholders may have limited capacity to make use of these transparency mechanisms and may have to adapt their expertise to fully use them. The {EMB} can help observers in this regard by educating them on the electronic voting or counting system being used and how they can effectively observe it. Certain mechanisms for providing transparency, such as the use of open source code, may be controversial, as vendors may be reluctant to disclose source code citing protection of intellectual property and the security of technologies. Irrespective of these interests, however, all software and hardware should be made available for independent review. Electoral contestants and election observers have a critical role to play in ensuring the transparency of an election process. It is not possible for everyone to understand e-voting and counting systems. Thus, voters rely on others who have the capacity to understand these processes. It is therefore essential that stakeholders, including election observers and party/candidate agents, have access to the process. To carry out their role effectively, such monitors must be given sufficient access both in law and practice to make an informed assessment. This may require that additional points of observation be created in the electoral process. With traditional paper-based voting and manual counting, observers focus on the voting and counting process itself. Electronic voting and counting technologies entail a number of other activities, some critical to the integrity of the process, that can be observed, but which take place well in advance of Election Day. Such activities include the testing and certification of the systems and the installation of software on voting or counting machines. Those observing elections need to make additional efforts to monitor these processes, which take place outside of the normal window of election observation. Observers and party/candidate agents must also have access to relevant documentation about the procurement, development, testing and certification of equipment. It is critical they are able to observe during each stage of the process, from the initial decision making about whether to use electronic voting, to the final announcement of results. The transparency of various stages of the process should be a key consideration in the observers’ overall assessment of the election. The ability of observers and party/candidate agents to fulfill their roles is more challenging in an election that uses electronic voting and counting technologies. Observers must be properly trained to understand and report on the processes they observe. Watching voters use an electronic voting machine is unlikely to provide the information necessary to effectively assess the voting process. They should, therefore, become knowledgeable about the specific technologies that have been adopted and should be prepared to evaluate the testing and auditing of the voting and counting equipment, as well as the documentation of the process.8 Since election observers and party/candidate agents may not have the expertise needed to understand certain aspects of electronic voting and counting technologies, organizations and parties may need to hire personnel specifically with an information and communications technology ({ICT}) background. They may also decide they are unable to assess certain aspects of the process and, if so, should disclose in their reporting which parts of the process they have and have not been able to observe effectively and take this into account in their overall assessment of electoral integrity. The complex nature of electronic voting and counting technologies may also require {ICT} experts to provide independent oversight of such technologies, especially regarding the review of software and hardware. Professional {ICT} groups and academic communities can play a useful role in assessing electronic voting, either in partnership with election observer groups or independently. While the {EMB} should not exclude organizations that are skeptical about the benefits of electronic voting or counting technologies, they should be aware of any such organizational agendas. 7 For more detailed information on this topic, please refer to the following subsections in Part 2: Pilot Project; Legal and Procedural Framework; Procurement, Production, and Delivery; Security Mechanisms; Voter Education; and Testing, Source Code Review and Certification. 8 For more detail on this point see Council of Europe (2011) Guidelines on transparency of e-enabled elections, available at www.coe.int.  {EXAMPLE}: Verifiability {NEXT}: Integrity  Back Home Next},

The goal of this workshop is to provide a multidisciplinary forum to address questions such as: How to model the interactions between people, data, and digital tools that create new spaces and forms of civic action in the digital era? How to analyse emerging properties and types of knowledge in these contexts? How to design socio-technical systems that effectively leverage data and knowledge for deliberation (or other types of participation) and collective decision making? Can we design the meta-rules of the emergent ecosystems?
The Workshop brings together participants from universities and research centers in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Brazil, Israel, {UK}, and the {USA}. The workshop received 10 submissions, covering a number of different areas in {AI} (e.g. multi-agent systems and machine learning), economics, political sciences, and law. All submitted versions were reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. These proceedings finally include nine of these papers and an invited keynote speech by Patrick Keyzer.
We sincerely thank the Program Committee members for reviewing all submitted papers and providing feedback to improve their revised versions. We are also grateful to the {IJCAI} 2017 chairs (Program Chair Carles Sierra, Workshops Chair Daniele Magazzeni and Local Arrangements co-Chair Andy Song) for their support in preparing this workshop. Last but not least, we would like to thank the participants who submitted their papers and afterwards produced the revised versions that are now composing these proceedings.},

Based on smart contracts, a special type of applications can be deployed, known as Decentralized Applications ({DApps}). Within existing Blockchain platforms, Ethereum is the most popular one adopted for {DApp} developments. The performance constraints of Ethereum dramatical impact usability of {DApp}. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the performances of Ethereum from 3 types of tests: 1) Account balance query latency 2) Block generation time and 3) End-to-end transaction acceptance latency. The results show that the end-to-end transaction time in Ethereum is unstable. Consequently, the applications with low latency constraints and high frequency transaction requirements are not ready to be deployed unless off-chain transaction methods are considered.},

	abstract = {This paper provides definitions for some desirable properties of voting systems, including auditability, ballot secrecy, incoercibility, usability and accessibility. In the context of these desirable properties, it defines the class of end-to-end independently verifiable (E2E) voting systems that provide high levels of auditability, without requiring voters or election observers to trust polling machines or election officials. It provides examples of E2E systems, and compares their auditability properties to those of other voting system classes. Finally, it presents areas for further research in auditable voting systems.},

	abstract = {The market is a decentralized system that can bring about efficient economic decisions. This paper examines whether social choice mechanisms can duplicate this success in the political arena. The famed Arrow result tells us centralized systems cannot achieve efficient, nondictatorial outcomes unless they rely on cardinal preferences. With decentralization, efficiency comes to require something more: the truthful revelation of preferences. Schemes that elicit honest preferences are derived here. By their very structure they are shown to lead to inefficient outcomes. This negative result leads to the question whether the validity of the initial analogy continues. Market-based standards of performance may be innappropriate for investigations of political phenomena.},

	abstract = {The 2016 presidential election provided a unique opportunity to revisit two competing hypotheses for how voters establish their perceptions of electoral integrity. First, mass public opinion is believed to derive from elite messages. In the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump maintained that the election system was “rigged,” while election administration experts and officials received considerable media coverage in their efforts to counter Trump’s claims. Second, literature on voter confidence has established a “winner effect”—voters who cast ballots for winners are more likely than voters on the losing side to believe their vote was counted correctly. Thus, voters were exposed to two theoretically opposite effects. In this paper, we find that the “winner” effect mitigates the effects from strong pre-election cues from elites. We also show the effect of pre-election attention to the rigging issue, find a symmetry of the election outcome effect for winners and losers, and reconsider our explanations of the winner effect. Finally, we go beyond the existing studies of the winner effect to consider the kind of citizens who are most susceptible to that effect.},
