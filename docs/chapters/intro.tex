Elections are the cornerstone modern democracies are built on and thus are arguably one of the most critical aspects of our democratic processes.
Consequently, ensuring fair elections and voting results that are trustworthy should be of concern to every democratic nation and its citizens.
However, no system is perfect, and analogous voting systems currently employed by democratic countries are no exception to this rule.

The consensus view is that voting systems must be secure, anonymous, transparent, and scalable
\autocites{lowry_desirable_2009}[5]{agora_agora_nodate}[9-11]{jafar_blockchain_2021},
which are properties that may not be impossible but very costly to achieve;\ even for industrialized nations.
Furthermore, even when a government allocates the necessary funds to secure its election processes, there is still no guarantee that this will ensure voters' trust in the election result,
as evidenced by presidential elections in the \Gls{USA}, where voter fraud theories dominated online discussions and news reports in the weeks and months following the 2016 and 2020 elections.
In the case of the \Gls{USA}, the distrust it could be argued that the distrust was partly caused by the fact that even though regular citizens can personally audit paper ballots, they usually do not possess the necessary skills to make statistical assessments.
At the same time, the voting process consists of several steps involving election officials or centralized software, which might be intransparent for a broad part of the population, thus providing critics with ample ground for speculation about election fraud.
Once such theories have gained traction, experience has shown that their spread is not easily stopped.
Therefore, many Democrats in the \Gls{USA} still believe that the 2016 election was manipulated~\autocite{sinclair_its_2018}
despite the fact that the Muller investigation has found no evidence of Russian interference~\autocite{muller_report_2019}, while many Republicans still believe widespread voter fraud is the reason,
Donald.\ J. Trump lost the 2020 election, even though statistical analysis of voter ballots don't confirm that hypothesis~\autocite{eggers_no_2021}.

So, is there a solution to those problems that would not only make elections more transparent to ordinary citizens but also more secure and straightforward?
This thesis aims at exploring the possibility of using blockchain technology for the development of a decentralized electronic voting system.
