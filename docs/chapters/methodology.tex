\section{Preparation}\label{sec:preparation}

\subsection{Selection of blockchain network}\label{subsec:selection-of-blockchain-network}

As seen in \cref{tab:selection-of-blockchain-network}, the findings in~\cref{sec:voting-systems} can be applied as selection criteria for relevant \gls{Blockchain} networks (see \cref{subsec:comparison-of-turing-complete-blockchains}).
However, some properties mentioned in~\cref{sec:voting-systems} are dependent entirely on decisions relating to frontend design and code governance, e.g., whether the software is open source, rather than the selected \gls{Blockchain}.
These are displayed in gray in~\cref{tab:selection-of-blockchain-network}.

    \end{tabularx}

\end{table}

All four \gls{Blockchain} networks seem to possess most of the properties mentioned in~\cref{sec:voting-systems}.
Nevertheless, as shown in \cref{subsec:comparison-of-turing-complete-blockchains}, scalability seems to be a major issue underlying blockchain technology in general.
For instance, even though the Ethereum Foundation is looking to improve Ethereum's protocol further, theoretically enabling it to process up to 100,000 \gls{TPS} in the future, as of the time of this writing, it is not able to process enough transactions to facilitate national elections.
Conversely, other \glspl{Blockchain} compromise on similarly essential features like security or network stability, an equally important scalability aspect, to achieve a higher number of \gls{TPS}.
Unfortunately, in the absence of a \gls{Blockchain} protocol that satisfies all aspects shown in~\cref{sec:voting-systems}, compromises in our selection process are unavoidable.
With this in mind, looking at \cref{tab:selection-of-blockchain-network}, Polygon seems to be the most logical choice as it runs on top of Ethereum.
Therefore, it automatically benefits from Ethereum's superior security and anonymity, as well as all future improvements made to Ethereum's protocol, while still giving it an edge in terms of scalability due to its Layer 2 protocol (see~\cref{subsec:comparison-of-turing-complete-blockchains}).

\subsection{Selection of technology stack}\label{subsec:selection-of-tech-stack}

There are certainly many frameworks that could be used to develop the server-side and the client-side of a decentralized electronic voting system.
However, we will rely on a full Node.js integration due to its non-blocking \gls{IO} to ensure high scalability (see~\cref{subsec:node.js}).
Similarly, given the scalability advantages of monorepos (see~\cref{subsec:nx}), we will utilize nx to manage the project's repository.
Furthermore, keeping transparency in mind (see~\cref{sec:voting-systems}), an open source project built with nx will be more accessible to other developers as a resource for future research.

We will use Next.js as a framework on the client side as it allows for server-side rendering, increasing the application's overall security (see~\cref{subsec:next.js}) and making it \glstext{SEO}-friendly.
Alternatively, we could have developed the client-side with Nuxt.js, which mimics most of Next's server-side and static rendering methods while using Vue.js instead of React.js under the hood.
However, Nuxt has a smaller community, making React the preferable option for our development purposes.

Although Next.js comes with its own routing framework for API calls, it is reasonable to use a separate framework for requests that handle database and smart contract actions.
For this reason, we will apply best practices for building backend applications by utilizing Nest.js.
As illustrated in~\cref{subsec:nest.js}, Nest.js is specifically designed with scalability in mind;
moreover, it will ensure high readability for developers with either an \gls{OOP} or \gls{FP} background.
Likewise, we will handle database-related aspects of the application using a PostgreSQL database since a broad spectrum of developers should be familiar with a \gls{ORDBMS} and PostgreSQL in particular (see~\cref{subsec:postgresql}).

\subsection{Architectural design}\label{subsec:architectural-design}


\section{Development}\label{sec:development}

\subsection{Versioning}\label{subsec:versioning}

We will use Git Workflows to version the project during development, enabling parallel workflows depending on features and thus providing greater flexibility.
Furthermore, it enables the analysis of code changes during our iterative process and potentially necessary revision of changes.
Git is well-established in the software industry and does not have serious contenders that are also open source.

\subsection{Agile development}\label{subsec:agile-development}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{jones-2010-development-methods}
    \caption[Development mehtods]{Development methods. Sorted by project size and success rates~\autocite[11]{jones_software_2010}}
    \label{fig:development-methods}
\end{figure}

The development methods displayed in \cref{fig:development-methods} are sorted according to their success rates.
As stated by~\textcite[10-12]{jones_software_2010}, projects with a size of less than 1000 function points are most likely to benefit from agile development methods.
The median size of function points is defined as 53 lines of JavaScript code by~\textcite{qsm_function_2009}.
Based on these findings, we will apply agile development methods during the development process as the project's size is not anticipated to grow beyond the aforementioned dimensions.

However, we will depart from the recommended defect prevention methods shown in~\cref{fig:development-methods} since embedded user reviews would mainly test the application’s frontend functionality.
Instead, the same goal can be achieved by applying Scrum methods and \gls{E2E} tests.

\subsection{Personal Scrum}\label{subsec:personal-scrum}

\subsection{End-to-end tests}\label{subsec:end-to-end-tests}

Since peer reviews are no feasible option for defect removal in a single-person project, we will employ E2E tests to check the application’s intended functionality and iteratively remove possible defects.
Also, in contrast to unit tests, \gls{E2E} tests provide the possibility to test entire workflows of the applications, such as the registration or voting process.
